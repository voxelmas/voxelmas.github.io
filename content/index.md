Voxelmas is a new challange to promote voxel art in the 24 days before Christmas, ending
right on Christmas Eve!

## Overview

Voxelmas has 2 different options: 1 prompt over 24 days, or 12 prompts over 24 days
(2 days each), to allow for maximum flexibility (after all, it's the holiday season
:D)

When you're done, post your image on social media and tag it with #voxelmas

## FAQ

### General

{{< collapse "Q. Is this new?" >}}
Yep! This year is the first time we're holding Voxelmas. It was inspired by Nodevember
and Sculptober.

{{< collapse "Q. Why are the prompts released in late November?" >}}
We want to make Voxelmas as least stressful as possible, so the prompts are released
in late November in order to allow people to plan ahead and play around with ideas.

{{< collapse "Q. How are the prompts chosen?" >}}
Prompts are selected to be as simple and flexible as possible, since it's the holiday
season :D. This also includes making the prompts as general as possible, so there
can be more variation with how prompts are interpreted.

We also try to base prompts off of the holiday season, although it should
be noted that there's a bit of a Northern Hemisphere bias with these (sorry Australians,
we know it's summer for y'all down there).

### Style

{{< collapse "Q. What qualifies as voxel art?" >}}
This is a bit tough to answer. *In general*, voxel art is in a cube-like style, and
in a way is 3D pixel art, but there are exceptions in general.

For the purposes of keeping things simple, "voxel art" in the context of Voxelmas
is anything that is *mostly* cubic and/or low-poly with pixel-art style textures.

That being said, we won't really press too hard on exact style, so feel free to try
and experiment with pushing the boundaries!

{{< collapse "Q. Is it fine to remesh a higher poly model into a cubic model?" >}}
Sure, but we feel that takes away from the idea of Voxelmas, and we recommend trying
to avoid remeshing.
