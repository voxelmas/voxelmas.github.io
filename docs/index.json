Is this new? Yep! This year is the first time we\u0026rsquo;re holding Voxelmas. It was inspired by Nodevember and Sculptober. Q. Why are the prompts released in late November? We want to make Voxelmas as least stressful as possible, so the prompts are released in late November in order to allow people to plan ahead and play around with ideas. Q. How are the prompts chosen? Prompts are selected to be as simple and flexible as possible, since it\u0026rsquo;s the holiday season :D. This also includes making the prompts as general as possible, so there can be more variation with how prompts are interpreted.\nWe also try to base prompts off of the holiday season, although it should be noted that there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a Northern Hemisphere bias with these (sorry Australians, we know it\u0026rsquo;s summer for y\u0026rsquo;all down there).\nQ. I have an idea for next year! Email mahid@standingpad.org and let him know! Style # Q. What qualifies as voxel art? This is a bit tough to answer. In general, voxel art is in a cube-like style, and in a way is 3D pixel art, but there are exceptions in general.\nFor the purposes of keeping things simple, \u0026ldquo;voxel art\u0026rdquo; in the context of Voxelmas is anything that is mostly cubic and/or low-poly with pixel-art style textures.\nThat being said, we won\u0026rsquo;t really press too hard on exact style, so feel free to try and experiment with pushing the boundaries!\nQ. Is it fine to remesh a higher poly model into a cubic model? Sure, but we feel that takes away from the idea of Voxelmas, and we recommend trying to avoid remeshing.
